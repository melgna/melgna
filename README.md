- 👋 Hi, I’m @melgna and i've been a big ol' internet lurker for more than 2 decades at this point.
- 👀 I’m interested in writing, video games, painting/drawing, saving the world, and hiking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of scripting languages at once. I've been primarily self-taught until now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 'i'm making a story-focused video game so i'll letcha know when i want to collab. it will be sooner than later'. tyvm.
- 📫 twitter (only) for now. i am all over the internet, but i am trying to focus on my art, writing, and other creative projects - and my coursework - for the next few months.
